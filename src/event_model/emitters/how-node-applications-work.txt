In Node Application, any async function accepts a callback as the last parameter and a
callback function accepts an error as the first parameter. 

Here fs.readFile() is asych function whose purpose is to read a file. If an error occurs
during the read operation, the the error object will contain the corresponding error else
data will contain the contents of the file. readFile() function passes error and data to
the callback function after the read operations is complete, which finally prints the content.
