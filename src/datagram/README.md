## Node.js UDP server and client example
> The **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite.
>
> With UPD, Node.js applications can send message, in this case referred to as *datagrams*, to other hosts
> on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
>
> Prior communications are not required in order to set up communication channels and data paths.

> UDP uses simple connectionless communications model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. 
>
> UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing functions at the source
> and the destination of the datagram.
