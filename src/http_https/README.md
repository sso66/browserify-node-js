## http_https: Implementing HTTP Services in Node.js

Implementing HTTP Services in Node.js 
### Reason
> One of the most important aspects of Node.js is the ability to 
> implement HTTP and HTTPS server and services quickly.

- Purpose
> Node.js provides the 'http' and 'https' modues out of the box,
> and they give you a basic framework to do just about anything
> you might need to do from an HTTP and HTTPS standpoint
>
> In fact, it is not dificult to implement a full webserver using
> just the 'http' module. However, the 'http' module is pretty 
> low level.
>
> You will likely to use different module to handle routing, 
> cookies, caching, etc. Explore 'express' module to see the advantages 
> of this module provides.
>
> What you will more likely be using the 'http' module for is 
> implementing backend web services for your applications.

- Impact
> This is where the 'http' module is an invaluable tool in your
> arsenal.
