Implementing HTTP Services in Node.js 
> One of the most important aspects of Node.js is the ability to

> and they give you a basic framework to do just about anything
> you might need to do from an HTTP and HTTPS standpoint
>
> In fact, it is not dificult to implement a full webserver using
> just the 'http' module.
