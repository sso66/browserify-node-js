### Programming for the Node.js Event Loop
  - Watching a File for Changes
  - Visualizing the Event Loop
  - Reading Command-Line Arguments
  - Spawing a Child Process
  - Capturing Data from an EventEmitter
  - Reading and Writing Files Asychronously
  - Creating Read and Write Streams
  - Blocking the Event Loop with Synchronous File Access
  - Performing Other File-System Operations: copy(), unlink(), chmod() and mkdir()
### The Two Phases of a Node.js Program
### Wrapping Up
  - Fortifying Code
  - Expanding Functionality
