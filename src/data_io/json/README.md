### Working with JSON
> One to the data types that you will most commonly work with when implementing Node.js
> web applications and services is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
>
> JSON is a very lightweight method to convert JavaScript objects inot a string form and then back again
>
> It works well when you need to serialize data objects when passing them from client to server, process
> process, or stream to stream or when you're storing them in a database.

> There are several reasons to use JSON to serialize your JavaScripts instead of XML:
> - JSON is much more efficient and takes fewer characters.
> - Serializing/deserializing JSON is faster then serializing/deserializing XML.
> - JSON is easier to read from developer's perspective because its syntax is similar to that of JavaScript.
