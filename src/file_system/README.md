- Summary

> Node.js provides the `fs` module, which allows you to interact with the file system. 
> The `fs` module allows you to create, read, modify files. You can also use the `fs`
> module to navigate the directory structure, looking at information about files and
> folders, as well as change the directory structure by deleting and renaming files
> and folders.

> Focus on using the `http` module to implement basic webservers. You will get a chance
> to see how to parse a query strings. You will learn how to implement a basic webserver
> in Node.js.
