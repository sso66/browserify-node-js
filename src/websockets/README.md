## websocket: Implementing WebSockets in Node.js
###Purpose:
> Sending a message and getting an instance response without refreshing the page is
> something we take for granted. But in the past, enabling realtime functionality was 
> a real challenge for developer. 
>
####Reason:
> The developer community has come a long from HTTP long polling and AJAX (Asyncyronous
> JavaScript And XML - eXtensible Markup Language) and has finally found a solution for
> building truly real-time applications in Node.js.
>
> This solution comes in the form of WebSockets, which make it possible to open an 
> interactive session between a user's browser and a server. 
>
> Websockets allow a browser to send messages to a server and receives event-driven
> responses with having to poll the server for a reply
